#BlackJack game using jQuery, HTML and CSS

###Setup the table using Bootstrap. 
Create a dealers hand and players hand to hold the totals.
Set each card to a custom width (adjust col-sm-2 to 11% to avoid having to write 3 extra divs).
Add 3 buttons to the bottom of the table so the user can interact with the game.

###Write some JavaScript!
Bind each button to a jQuery click function and call the correct function depending on the click.
